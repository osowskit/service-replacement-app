# GitHub Services Migration App - Migration Edition.

On April 25, 2018, Github announced it plans on [shutting down GitHub Services](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/replacing-github-services/). This application can help identify how and where your Accounts are [using GitHub Services](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/replacing-github-services/#migrating-with-our-help) for Jenkins, Docker, codereviewhub, and others...

This app lets you authenticate with GitHub and check whether any of your repositories have a GitHub Services installed.
